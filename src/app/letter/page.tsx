          Dear Shandra. I know this might be unexpected, but I wanted to reach
          out and apologize for the hurt I caused you. I never meant to hurt
          you, and I deeply regret my actions. I understand if you need space,
          but I hope we can find a way to reconnect someday...
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed italic">
          And about the instagram follow, i just want to clarify that..

          I didn‚Äôt follow her back because I wanted to get back together, it was
          only as a friend. I truly never realized it would hurt you, and I‚Äôm
          deeply sorry for that. I know it might be too late, but please know I
          never wanted to cause you pain. You‚Äôve meant a lot to me, and I only
          wish you peace and happiness, always...
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If space is what you need, I will respect it. But please know...
